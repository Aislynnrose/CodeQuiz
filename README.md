## How this works

* If a user selects the wrong answer in the quiz, the timer will deduct 10 seconds as a penalty.
* If a user selects the correct answer the timer will continue as normal.
* If the time runs out the game will stop.
* A user will enter their initials to add to the highscore list stored in local storage.
